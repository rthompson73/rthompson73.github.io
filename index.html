At AFHAR we give homeless dogs a place to be loved, cared for, trained and hope for a home. Our average intake is about 20 dogs per month coming<br>
 in from shelters, as strays, or owners who can no longer care for their pet. To find our dogs for adoption click here. We have several cats for adoption as well.<br>
 Please go to <a href="https://www.petfinder.com/pet-search?shelter_id=FL1026">www.petfinder.com</a> or <a href="http://afhar.rescueme.org/">www.rescueme.org</a> for a full list of all pets for adoption.<br>

<br>AFHAR is looking for a piece of property to make our dream come true of moving and building our own facility.<br><br>

If you are interested in boarding your dog, please call for an appointment. All proceeds are used to help rescued dogs. </div>
